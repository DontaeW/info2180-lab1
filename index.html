        <h2>Dontae Whitely</h2>
        <p>My name is Dontae Whitely and I am a student of the University of the West Indies. I am in my third year, of pursuing a degree 
            in Electronics and Computer Science. Cars are one of the things I am most passionate about in my life and I hope to have multiple.
            I am interested in web development because it is necessary for my professional development. I believe it is imperative for
            me to learn how to create and maintain a website as someone who will pursue a career in computer science.</p>
